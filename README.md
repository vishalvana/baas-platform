# BaaS Platform

A scalable, multi-tenant Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform built with Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

BaaS Platform provides developers with production-ready backend infrastructure including authentication, project isolation, API key management, and dynamic JSON document storage.

The platform is designed around modern backend engineering principles such as stateless authentication, layered architecture, dynamic schema handling, and multi-tenant system design.

# Overview

BaaS Platform enables developers to integrate backend functionality into their applications without building backend infrastructure from scratch.

The platform exposes APIs for:

* Authentication
* Project management
* Dynamic document storage
* App user management
* API key-based access

The architecture is inspired by platforms such as Firebase, Supabase, and Auth0.

---

# Core Features

## Authentication as a Service

The platform provides JWT-based authentication for:

* Platform developers
* Application end users

Features include:

* User registration
* Secure login
* Password hashing using BCrypt
* JWT token generation
* Stateless authentication

---

## Multi-Tenant Project Management

Each developer account can create and manage multiple isolated projects.

Every project includes:

* Unique Project ID
* Dedicated API key
* Isolated application users
* Isolated collections and documents

Example:

```text
Developer
 ├── ChatApp
 ├── EcommercePlatform
 └── NotesApplication
```

---

## Dynamic JSON Document Storage

The platform supports schema-less JSON document storage using PostgreSQL JSONB.

Developers can store any JSON structure dynamically without defining database entities.

Example:

```json
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "views": 120,
  "published": true
}
```

Supported use cases:

* Posts
* Products
* Orders
* Messages
* Activity feeds
* Custom application data

---

## API Key Security

Application-level APIs are secured using project API keys.

Example:

```http
x-api-key: sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## Centralized Exception Handling

The platform uses a global exception handling mechanism for:

* Validation errors
* Authentication failures
* Business logic exceptions
* API consistency

Standardized API responses improve frontend integration and SDK development.

---

# System Architecture

The platform follows a layered architecture.

```text
Controller Layer
        ↓
Service Layer
        ↓
Repository Layer
        ↓
PostgreSQL Database
```

## Architectural Principles

* Stateless authentication
* Separation of concerns
* DTO-driven API contracts
* Multi-tenant isolation
* API-first backend design
* Centralized security

---

# Technology Stack

## Backend Framework

* Java 21
* Spring Boot
* Spring Security
* Spring Data JPA
* Hibernate

## Database

* PostgreSQL
* PostgreSQL JSONB

## Authentication & Security

* JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* BCrypt Password Encoder
* API Key Authentication

## Build Tools

* Maven
* Lombok
* Jackson

---

# Authentication Architecture

The platform contains two independent authentication systems.

---

## 1. Platform Authentication

Used by developers who manage projects on the platform.

### Endpoints

```http
POST /auth/signup
POST /auth/login
```

Returns JWT access token.

---

## 2. App User Authentication

Used by client applications to authenticate their own users.

### Endpoints

```http
POST /sdk/auth/signup
POST /sdk/auth/login
```

Protected using:

```http
x-api-key
```

This enables developers to use the platform as an external authentication provider.

---

# Multi-Tenant Design

The platform uses project-level tenant isolation.

Each project has:

* Independent application users
* Independent collections
* Independent document storage
* Dedicated API credentials

Example:

```text
ChatApp Users ≠ Ecommerce Users
```

This ensures proper tenant separation and secure project boundaries.

---

# Dynamic Data Engine

The platform stores dynamic application data using PostgreSQL JSONB.

## Collection-Based API Design

```http
POST /api/{projectId}/{collection}
GET  /api/{projectId}/{collection}
```

Example:

```http
POST /api/project-id/posts
```

The system dynamically stores JSON documents without requiring schema migrations.

---

# Security Model

## JWT Authentication

Used for:

* Platform authentication
* App user authentication

Features:

* Stateless authentication
* Token expiration
* Secure signature verification

---

## Password Encryption

Passwords are encrypted using BCrypt before storage.

The platform never stores plain-text passwords.

---

## API Key Protection

Dynamic collection APIs are protected using project-specific API keys.

---

## Validation & Exception Handling

The platform includes:

* Request validation
* Centralized exception handling
* Standardized API responses

---

# API Reference

## Platform Authentication

### Register Platform User

```http
POST /auth/signup
```

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "Vishal",
  "email": "vishal@gmail.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

---

### Login Platform User

```http
POST /auth/login
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "token": "jwt-token"
  }
}
```

---

## Project APIs

### Create Project

```http
POST /projects
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Project created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "project-id",
    "name": "ChatApp",
    "apiKey": "sk_xxxxx"
  }
}
```

---
